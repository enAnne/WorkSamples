# Treasure Hunt
This is a treasure hunt clue-location assignment tool. This simple treasure hunt game is where there needs not be fascillitators stationed at each location, but just well placed clues at their locations leading the players to their next clue, and the game can run smoothly on it's own.

# Challenge
When creating a treasure hunt game where there are multiple teams/players racing each other, the sequence of clues for every team should be different from all others, so that the different teams do not get into the situation where they just follow each other through the game to reach the finish line.

# Solution
Enter the number of teams in the game, and the python script will generate the assignment of clues to each location.

The excel file "TreasureHunt.xlsx" shows an example of how to set up the clues and locations for a treasure hunt game.
