# Geographical Map
This project uses free API's to geo-code addresses and create a heatmap and a bubble map to represent density of these coordinate points.

## Challenge
When deciding on the location to open a new store/outlet, it is useful to understand the density and distribution (potential) customers.

## Solution
Geographical heatmaps/bubble maps are useful visual representation that allows users to have a birds-eye view on points of interests. The bubble map displays a bubble at the centre of a group of points, and the number indicates the density of points. The ability to zoom in and see the bubbles adjust its granularity is an added advantage of bubble maps.
