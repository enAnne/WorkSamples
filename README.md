# Work Samples
Here is a repository of my own hobby projects which I propose to my company for adoption.

## Project 1: Charging Station Analysis
An analysis of the EV readiness of APAC countries, based on the coverage of public EV Charging stations. Data is scraped from public maps and websites.

## Project 2: Contact Tracing
An graph network analysis of who knows who, of up to 5 degrees of separation.

## Project 3: Database Summary
Scans a large table structure and compiles into PDF a summary of its meaningful data points, using visual representation and statistics.

## Project 4: PowerBI Data Model Reduction
Summarize which tables or fields within the data model are unused and can be dropped, to minimize the PBIX file size.
